Description:

My chatbot is a C# console application designed to promote cybersecurity awareness among users.
It interacts through text input and provides helpful, beginner-friendly guidance on topics like password safety,
phishing, malware, and safe internet practices. The chatbot uses keyword recognition to respond appropriately 
to user queries and aims to simulate real-world cybersecurity support with educational value.

"I've significantly enhanced your cybersecurity chatbot to make it more intuitive, personalized, and emotionally intelligent. Now I can better understand when users want to explore topics or learn about scams through natural language patterns. I've added the ability to remember users' favorite topics and even recall specific things they've told me about their interests, making our conversations feel more personal and continuous. My emotional intelligence has been upgraded too - I can now detect emotional intensity over time and adjust my responses accordingly, whether you're frustrated, excited, or confused. I've enriched my knowledge base with more detailed cybersecurity information, organized into comprehensive categories with related keywords, so I can understand questions even when users don't use exact technical terms. The tips system has been expanded to provide more targeted advice, and I can now better handle general conversation flows about my purpose or capabilities. Overall, I've become more than just an information source - I'm now a more thoughtful, responsive companion for cybersecurity learning that adapts to each user's interests and emotional state throughout our conversations."
